# FishOS
FishOS is currently only bootable from floppy disk, and I can't guarantee that it will work on real hardware. It currently has a somewhat working FAT12 driver, some string functions and is able to print things using printf.

### Building
You can build on Linux with make if you have [nasm](https://github.com/netwide-assembler/nasm), [open watcom V2](https://github.com/open-watcom/open-watcom-v2) (with 16-bit compilers enabled) and [mtools](https://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/) installed.
