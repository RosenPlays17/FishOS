# FishOS
FishOS is currently only bootable from floppy disk, and I can't guarantee that it will work on real hardware. In its current state, it is able to print the string "Among Us" and a bunch of random numbers and strings to test printf.

### Building
You can build on Linux using [nasm](https://github.com/netwide-assembler/nasm), [open watcom V2](https://github.com/open-watcom/open-watcom-v2) (with 16-bit compilers enabled) and [mtools](https://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/).
